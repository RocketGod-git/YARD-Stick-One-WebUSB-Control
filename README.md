## Created by ðŸš€RocketGodðŸš€


## Overview
The **YARD Stick One WebUSB Control Interface** is a sleek and intuitive web-based tool for controlling the **YARD Stick One** RF transceiver directly from your browser using **WebUSB**. This interface allows for setting transmission parameters, testing signals, and receiving RF data with ease.

Built for experimenters, security researchers, and RF enthusiasts, this tool bridges the gap between browser-based control and low-level RF experimentation. Whether you're exploring signal transmissions or tinkering with radio frequencies, this interface is designed to be **fast, minimal, and effective**.

## Features
- **WebUSB Integration** â€“ Directly communicate with your **YARD Stick One** without drivers.
- **Set & Adjust Parameters** â€“ Configure frequency, modulation, and baud rate seamlessly.
- **Transmit Signals** â€“ Send raw RF data in hex format.
- **Test Carrier** â€“ Easily generate a repeating signal for quick verification.
- **Minimalist UI** â€“ Designed for clarity and efficiency, with a dark-themed interface.

## Supported Modulations
- ASK/OOK
- GFSK
- FSK
- MSK

## Requirements
- **YARD Stick One** (by **Great Scott Gadgets**)
- A **WebUSB-compatible browser** (Chrome-based recommended)

## ToDo
- **NOT WORKING** - Currently the signal doesn't make it to the YS1 antenna. Everything appears fine but nothing received on my receivers.
- **Live Receiving** â€“ Capture and display RF data in real-time.

## Credits
This project is inspired by and built for the **RF research community**. Special thanks to:
- **[Great Scott Gadgets](https://greatscottgadgets.com/yardstickone/)** for creating the **YARD Stick One**
- **[RFCat](https://github.com/atlas0fd00m/rfcat)** for pioneering open-source RF hacking tools

## Notes
This project is an independent web-based interface and is not affiliated with **Great Scott Gadgets** or **RFCat**. It's designed for responsible RF experimentation within legal limits. Just kidding, do what you want. I'm not the FCC.
